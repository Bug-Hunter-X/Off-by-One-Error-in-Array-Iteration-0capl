This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  Off-by-one errors are subtle but can lead to unexpected exceptions or incorrect results. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when dealing with arrays.
